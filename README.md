I am a 19-year-old software developer based in Astrakhan ðŸ‡·ðŸ‡º.

I started programming in 2017, and in 2018 I completed my first internship at the Sirius Educational Center. I also went there in 2019 for the "Classic Programming and Mobile Development" shift.

Currently I'm getting a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science. I'm graduating in 2023.
